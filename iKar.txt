Here's the assignment description: One of your friends contacts you with the idea of opening a car rental service. Knowing that you are studying computer programming, they ask you to create the website for the business. The following document outlines the rental service's specifications. There’s just one problem: they want to launch the business at the beginning of the next year, and they absolutely need your help! Create the iKarRental website by January 12! Basic Features
In this assignment, you are tasked with creating a PHP application where users can view cars uploaded by an administrator without logging in. Logged-in users can book these cars for specific time periods.

Browsing Cars: Guest users can browse the available cars listed on the homepage. They can filter cars by various criteria, including available time periods and specific attributes.
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and access their bookings on a profile page.
Booking Cars: Logged-in users can book available cars for specific time intervals.
Administrator Access: The administrator can add new cars, edit existing ones, and delete them. Page Functions
Homepage / Listing Page
The homepage should display a list of all available cars.
Users should be able to filter cars on the homepage by key attributes, such as:
Availability within a specific time range (showing cars free between two dates).
Transmission type (Automatic/Manual).
Number of passengers (showing cars with seating capacity greater than the specified number).
Daily price (showing cars with a daily price within a specified range).
Car name, image, and basic attributes (brand, type, passengers, transmission, daily price) should be displayed.
Guest users can see the cars but need to register and log in to book. Car Details Page
Clicking on a car from the homepage should display the car’s detailed page, which includes all its attributes:
{
  "id": 1,
  "brand": "Honda",
  "model": "Civic",
  "year": 2019,
  "transmission": "Manual",
  "fuel_type": "Petrol",
  "passengers": 5,
  "daily_price_huf": 16250,
  "image": "https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/honda/civic/2019/oem/2019_honda_civic_sedan_touring_fq_oem_1_815.jpg"
}
Logged-in users can book the car for a specific period. Guest users trying to book a car should be redirected to the login page or see an error message. Clicking the "Book" button should navigate to a new page, notifying the user of the booking’s success or failure.
Success: Displays the car’s basic information, an image, the booking details, and the total price of the booking (number of days * daily price).
Failure: If the car is already booked for the selected period, a failure message should be displayed, along with a button to return to the homepage. Authentication Pages
Registration Form
Required Fields:
Full Name
Email Address
Password
Error Handling:
Validation warnings for invalid email addresses, weak passwords, or missing fields.
Real-time feedback to improve user experience.
Login Page

Required Fields:
Email Address
Password Error Handling:
Alerts for incorrect credentials or empty fields. Logout Functionality

A logout button should be available:
Clearly displayed on the profile page.
Accessible from any other page in the system.
Profile page for logged in users
The profile page is accessible to logged-in users and includes the following:

Reservation List: Displays the user's previous reservations.
Logout Functionality: A clear button for logging out. Admin Functions
Separate login functionality for the administrator (default admin credentials: email: admin@ikarrental.hu, password: admin).
On the administrator's "Profile" page, all bookings should be displayed.
The administrator can:
Add new cars.
Edit existing cars, including deleting related bookings.
Delete cars. Additional Requirements
A polished appearance is important. This doesn’t necessarily mean a flashy design but at least a mobile-friendly layout. You can choose a minimalist style, add background images or graphical elements with your own CSS, or use a CSS framework.
Data entered into forms must be validated server-side during request processing. Disable browser validation by adding the novalidate attribute to form elements.
The completed project must be submitted as a compressed file containing all necessary files and a properly completed README.md file in the project’s root directory by the deadline.
You may NOT use any frameworks or external PHP libraries. Only CSS frameworks are allowed. Data Storage
The assignment assumes three types of models:

Car:
Unique ID (id).
Brand (brand).
Model (model).
Year (year).
Fuel Type (fuel_type).
Passenger Capacity (passengers).
Daily Price in HUF (daily_price_huf).
Image URL.
User:
Full Name.
Email Address (unique).
Password.
Admin Status.
Booking:
Start Date.
End Date.
User Email.
Car ID. (Links to an external site.)
Example for car storage

It is strongly recommended to use the Storage class shown in class, rather than creating it from scratch. Avoid these...
These are simple but important requests that you should avoid doing with your assigment, otherwise we won't be able to give you a grade.

Avoid leaving any errors in your code! Only functioning parts can be graded.
Generate your HTML from the data dynamically! Avoid echo-ing out HTML code!
Spend some time with organizing your code. It will be much easier for us to find points for you, if the code is clean enough for that.

I’ve created the skeleton for the iKarRental assignment based on your provided description and the workflow from your earlier examples. This main PHP script routes requests to appropriate pages, handles user sessions, and ensures role-based access control.

Each functionality (e.g., homepage, car details, booking, authentication, and admin operations) is modularized into different pages/ files, allowing clean separation of concerns. You can now add implementations for the specific pages mentioned (homepage.php, car_details.php, booking.php, login.php, register.php, and admin.php).

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific module or provide examples for one of the included pages?

Got it! I'll create the homepage so that it dynamically displays cars by fetching them from a file containing objects like the one you provided. The cars will be read from a JSON file, and PHP will handle loading and rendering them on the page.

Here’s the plan:

JSON File: A file (cars.json) will store car data in the format you've provided.
PHP Script: The homepage PHP script will:
Read the cars.json file.
Dynamically generate the HTML to display the cars.
Homepage: The cars will be displayed in a grid layout similar to the image you shared.

Explanation:
Dynamic Rendering: The index.php reads data from cars.json and generates a card for each car.
Filters: The filter form provides options to filter cars (though backend filtering isn’t implemented yet).
Book Button: Each car card links to a details.php page for booking details.
CSS: Matches the visual style from the image.
Let me know if you want filtering or booking implemented next!

how to make the info area smaller and more compact below each card image
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To make the information area smaller and more compact below each card image, you can adjust the padding, font size, and spacing in the .car-info CSS class. Here's how you can modify it:

Updated CSS for .car-info
css
Copy code
.car-info {
  padding: 5px; /* Reduce padding */
  font-size: 14px; /* Decrease font size */
  line-height: 1.4; /* Tighter spacing between lines */
}

.car-info h3 {
  font-size: 16px; /* Slightly larger for the title */
  margin: 5px 0; /* Add some space around the title */
}

.car-info p {
  margin: 3px 0; /* Reduce space between paragraphs */
  font-size: 13px; /* Slightly smaller font size for additional details */
}

.car-info .btn {
  margin-top: 5px; /* Reduce space above the button */
  padding: 5px 8px; /* Smaller button size */
  font-size: 13px; /* Match compact look */
}
Results of These Changes
Padding: The overall padding inside the .car-info box is reduced to make it tighter.
Font Sizes: Text font sizes are decreased for a more compact appearance.
Spacing: Adjustments to margins ensure minimal vertical space between text elements.
Button: The button is resized to look proportionate to the compact design.
Before & After
Before:

The .car-info area took up more space with larger font sizes and spacing.
After:

A more compact area with tighter spacing between the title, details, and button.
Let me know if you want to fine-tune it further or add other styling adjustments!





You said:
i want the footer text to be center aligned
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To center-align the text in the footer, you can use CSS by setting the text-align property to center. Here's how you can do it:

Updated CSS for the Footer
css
Copy code
footer {
  text-align: center; /* Centers the text horizontally */
  padding: 10px 0; /* Add some vertical padding for spacing */
  background-color: #111; /* Optional: Adjust background color */
  color: #fff; /* Optional: Adjust text color */
  font-size: 14px; /* Optional: Adjust font size */
}
Explanation:
text-align: center: Ensures that all text within the footer is horizontally centered.
padding: 10px 0: Adds vertical padding to create space above and below the footer text.
Optional Styling: Adjust background color (background-color), text color (color), or font size (font-size) as needed.
Example HTML:
html
Copy code
<footer>
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
This will ensure that the footer text is neatly centered. Let me know if you'd like to make additional adjustments!





You said:
idk its not working
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the footer text is not centering, there may be other CSS rules or layout structures affecting its alignment. Let’s troubleshoot and ensure it works properly. Try the following steps:

1. Ensure Footer is Displayed Correctly
Verify that your footer is a block-level element (it should be by default). Add the following CSS:

css
Copy code
footer {
  width: 100%; /* Ensure it spans the full width */
  text-align: center; /* Center-align the text */
  margin: 0 auto; /* Center the footer horizontally */
  padding: 10px 0; /* Add space around the text */
  background-color: #111; /* Optional: Background color */
  color: #fff; /* Optional: Text color */
}
2. Check for Other CSS Rules
Inspect the page with your browser’s developer tools to see if there are conflicting styles. Ensure no other rules (e.g., display: flex; justify-content: space-between;) are overriding your footer’s styling.

3. HTML Example
Make sure the HTML is structured correctly:

html
Copy code
<footer>
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
4. Add a Test Class (Optional)
If the issue persists, try adding a test class to isolate the footer:

html
Copy code
<footer class="footer-center">
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
CSS:

css
Copy code
.footer-center {
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 10px 0;
  background-color: #111;
  color: #fff;
}
5. Debugging with Developer Tools
Right-click on the footer in your browser and select Inspect.
Check the computed styles for text-align. If it's not center, check which rule is overriding it.
Let me know if this fixes the issue or if you'd like further guidance!





You said:
idk when i inspect it in the browswer, no edits that i make to the css of footer / footer p show up
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the CSS changes to the footer or footer p elements aren't applying when you inspect and edit them in the browser, the issue may be related to one of the following:

1. Check for a Specificity Issue
There may be another CSS rule that is more specific and overriding your footer or footer p styles. To fix this:

Try adding more specificity to your CSS, for example:

css
Copy code
body footer {
  text-align: center;
}
Use !important (only as a last resort):

css
Copy code
footer {
  text-align: center !important;
}
2. Ensure the Correct File is Linked
Your CSS file might not be correctly linked to the HTML. Check your <link> tag in the <head> of your HTML:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Confirm that the path to the styles.css file is correct.
Try clearing your browser cache (sometimes old versions of the CSS are cached):
Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R
3. Inline CSS Test
If external styles aren't applying, test using inline CSS directly in the HTML:

html
Copy code
<footer style="text-align: center; background-color: #111; color: #fff;">
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
If this works, there’s an issue with the CSS file being read or overridden.
4. Inspect for Framework Conflicts
If you're using a framework like Bootstrap or another CSS library:

These frameworks often have default styles for elements like footer or p.
Look for styles like display: flex; or justify-content: space-between; in your footer element using browser developer tools.
5. Debug in the Browser
Use the browser's developer tools to debug:

Right-click on the footer in the browser and choose Inspect.
Look for the Styles tab in the developer tools.
Check for any crossed-out rules or conflicting rules for footer or footer p.
Verify whether your CSS file is listed under the applied rules.
6. Potential Issues with JavaScript
If the footer is being dynamically updated by JavaScript, make sure that:

The script isn't overwriting your styles.
The footer exists when your styles are applied.
7. Reset Default Browser Styles
Browsers apply default styles to elements. To ensure consistency, reset the footer styles:

css
Copy code
footer {
  all: unset;
  text-align: center;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px 0;
  background-color: #111;
  color: #fff;
}
Let me know if none of these approaches resolve the issue, and we can troubleshoot further!





You said:
they arent even crosse out...just absent
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the styles are completely absent in the browser's inspector, here's how to debug and resolve this:

1. Check the CSS Link in HTML
Confirm that the CSS file containing your footer styles is properly linked in the HTML. Open your HTML file and look for something like this:
html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
If the styles.css file is in a subfolder (e.g., css/), adjust the path:
html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
Test the connection by making an obvious change in the CSS, such as:
css
Copy code
body {
  background-color: red;
}
If the background doesn't change, the CSS file isn't being loaded.
2. Inspect the Network Tab
Open Developer Tools in your browser (Ctrl + Shift + I or Cmd + Shift + I on Mac).
Go to the Network tab.
Reload the page and check if your styles.css file is listed.
If it’s not listed, the file isn’t being loaded.
If it shows a 404 error, the path to the file is incorrect.
3. Clear Browser Cache
Your browser might be caching an older version of the CSS file. To clear it:

Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Alternatively, add a query string to the CSS link to force the browser to reload it:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=1.0">
4. Check for Inline or Embedded Styles
If you don’t see any styles applied to the footer in the browser:

Look for <style> tags or style="" attributes in the HTML that might be overriding or replacing the external CSS file.
For example:

html
Copy code
<footer style="text-align: center;">
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
If this is present, it will override external CSS.

5. Debug Missing Rules
If the footer styles don’t appear in the browser inspector:

Make sure the rules are present in the correct CSS file:
css
Copy code
footer {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #111;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 0;
}
Verify you are editing the correct CSS file (there might be multiple linked CSS files).
Double-check that the class names, IDs, or tag selectors match exactly with the HTML.
6. Reapply Footer Styles Inline
To test whether your footer styles apply at all, try this in the HTML:

html
Copy code
<footer style="text-align: center; background-color: #111; color: #fff;">
  © 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.
</footer>
If the styles apply inline but not from the external CSS, it confirms that the CSS file isn’t loading correctly.

7. Test with a Minimal HTML/CSS Setup
If the issue persists, isolate the problem by creating a simple test: HTML:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <title>Footer Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <footer>© 2024 iKarRental - All rights reserved.</footer>
</body>
</html>
CSS (styles.css):

css
Copy code
footer {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #111;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 0;
}
Open this file in the browser. If it works, the issue is with your larger project setup.

If these steps don’t help, share more details about your setup, such as file structure, the footer element in the HTML, and where the CSS is located. This will help pinpoint the issue.

This file defines a system for managing data storage, reading, and writing in PHP. Here's how it helps and how you might use it in your project:

Overview of the Provided Code
File Input/Output (FileIO and Implementations):

The FileIO class and its implementations (JsonIO, SerializeIO) handle saving and loading data to/from files.
JsonIO: Saves and loads data in JSON format.
SerializeIO: Saves and loads data using PHP's serialization format.
Data Storage (Storage Class):

This class provides methods for managing data records in memory, with functionality for:
Adding, updating, and deleting records.
Finding records by criteria (ID, specific parameters, or custom conditions).
Bulk operations like updating or deleting multiple records.
Changes to the in-memory data are automatically saved back to the file when the Storage object is destroyed.
Key Components and How They Work
1. Interfaces
IFileIO: Defines the methods save($data) and load(), ensuring all file I/O classes implement these.
IStorage: Defines methods for managing records, like add, findById, update, and more.
2. FileIO Implementations
Base Class (FileIO): Handles checking the validity of the file path.
JsonIO:
load(): Reads JSON data from the file and converts it to an array.
save(): Converts an array or object to JSON and writes it to the file.
SerializeIO:
load(): Reads serialized data from the file and converts it back to PHP objects/arrays.
save(): Converts PHP data to a serialized format and writes it to the file.
3. Storage Class
Acts as an abstraction layer for working with data records in memory, while automatically saving and loading data from the file system.
Supports flexible searching, bulk operations, and CRUD operations.
How It Might Help Your Project
Data Storage and Persistence:

This code allows you to store car-related data (like the JSON object you shared earlier) in a file and access it easily.
Use JsonIO for working with JSON data files.
CRUD Operations:

You can use the Storage class to manage your car records:
Add new cars using add().
Search for cars with specific criteria using findAll() or findOne().
Update or delete existing cars by ID.
File Management:

It handles the complexity of file reading/writing and ensures data integrity by saving changes when the script ends.
Example Usage
1. Initialize a Storage for Cars
Assume you have a file named cars.json that stores car data:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "brand": "Honda",
    "model": "Civic",
    "year": 2019,
    "transmission": "Manual",
    "fuel_type": "Petrol",
    "passengers": 5,
    "daily_price_huf": 16250,
    "image": "https://example.com/honda.jpg"
  }
]
PHP Code:

php
Copy code
<?php
require_once 'path_to_the_provided_code.php';

try {
    // Initialize JSON-based storage
    $fileIO = new JsonIO('cars.json');
    $storage = new Storage($fileIO);

    // Add a new car
    $newCar = [
        "brand" => "Toyota",
        "model" => "Corolla",
        "year" => 2020,
        "transmission" => "Automatic",
        "fuel_type" => "Diesel",
        "passengers" => 5,
        "daily_price_huf" => 18000,
        "image" => "https://example.com/toyota.jpg"
    ];
    $storage->add($newCar);

    // Find all cars by a specific brand
    $hondaCars = $storage->findAll(["brand" => "Honda"]);
    print_r($hondaCars);

    // Update a car's daily price
    $carId = "1";
    $car = $storage->findById($carId);
    if ($car) {
        $car['daily_price_huf'] = 17000;
        $storage->update($carId, $car);
    }

    // Delete a car by ID
    $storage->delete("1");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
Integration in Your Project
Define a File for Car Data:

Create a JSON file (e.g., cars.json) to store car records.
Set Up the Storage System:

Use JsonIO with Storage to load, add, and manage car data in this file.
Use Storage in Your Application Logic:

For example, when a user views, edits, or deletes cars in the web interface, use the Storage methods to update the file.
Persist Data Automatically:

The destructor of Storage ensures that all changes are saved when the script ends.

so okay first of all, i get to the details page when i click book under a car. What i really need is to also be directed to the same page when i click on the image of a car as well
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To make the image of a car clickable and redirect to the details page (just like the "Book" button), follow these steps:

1. Wrap the Image in a Link
In your HTML or dynamically generated PHP code, wrap the car image inside an <a> tag that links to the details page. For example:

php
Copy code
<a href="details.php?id=<?= $car['id'] ?>">
    <img src="<?= $car['image'] ?>" alt="<?= $car['brand'] . ' ' . $car['model'] ?>">
</a>
This will make the image a clickable link. When clicked, it redirects to details.php with the car's unique id as a URL parameter.

2. Update Your Car Card Template
If you're generating the car cards dynamically in PHP, make sure you adjust the part where the image is being rendered. Here’s an example of a complete car card:

php
Copy code
<div class="car-card">
    <a href="details.php?id=<?= $car['id'] ?>">
        <img src="<?= $car['image'] ?>" alt="<?= $car['brand'] . ' ' . $car['model'] ?>">
    </a>
    <div class="info">
        <h3><?= $car['brand'] . ' ' . $car['model'] ?></h3>
        <p>Year: <?= $car['year'] ?></p>
        <p>Transmission: <?= $car['transmission'] ?></p>
        <p>Fuel: <?= $car['fuel_type'] ?></p>
        <p>Passengers: <?= $car['passengers'] ?></p>
        <p>Price: <?= $car['daily_price_huf'] ?> HUF/day</p>
        <a href="details.php?id=<?= $car['id'] ?>" class="btn">Book</a>
    </div>
</div>
3. Ensure the details.php Script Handles the ID
In your details.php file, retrieve the car's id from the URL and display its details. For example:

php
Copy code
<?php
require_once 'path_to_storage.php';

// Initialize storage
$fileIO = new JsonIO('cars.json');
$storage = new Storage($fileIO);

// Get the car ID from the URL
$carId = $_GET['id'] ?? null;

if ($carId) {
    // Find the car by ID
    $car = $storage->findById($carId);
    if ($car) {
        // Display the car details
        echo "<h1>{$car['brand']} {$car['model']}</h1>";
        echo "<img src='{$car['image']}' alt='{$car['brand']} {$car['model']}'>";
        echo "<p>Year: {$car['year']}</p>";
        echo "<p>Transmission: {$car['transmission']}</p>";
        echo "<p>Fuel: {$car['fuel_type']}</p>";
        echo "<p>Passengers: {$car['passengers']}</p>";
        echo "<p>Price: {$car['daily_price_huf']} HUF/day</p>";
    } else {
        echo "<p>Car not found!</p>";
    }
} else {
    echo "<p>No car selected!</p>";
}
?>
4. (Optional) Add Styles for Clickable Images
You can add a hover effect or cursor change to indicate that the image is clickable. In your CSS:

css
Copy code
.car-card a img {
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.car-card a img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
Result
Clicking the car's image will redirect to the details page for that specific car.
The "Book" button will still work as before.
Let me know if you'd like further help setting this up!

umm so i kinda dk whats going on. No changes i make in css are being shown on the inspect in browser, nor can they be seen. Howerver, if i edit the href for styles.css i html all CSS DOES disappear. Whats going on
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It sounds like your browser might be caching your CSS file, which means it’s not loading your latest changes even though the file is being linked correctly. Here's how to debug and fix the issue:

1. Confirm CSS Link in HTML
Ensure that your styles.css file is linked correctly in the <head> section of your HTML file. The link should look something like this:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
If the CSS disappears when you change the href, the browser is likely recognizing the file but serving a cached version.

2. Clear Browser Cache
Browsers often cache CSS files for faster load times. To force the browser to fetch the updated file:

Press Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac) to hard-refresh the page.
Alternatively, clear your browser cache manually:
In Chrome: Open DevTools (right-click → "Inspect" or F12), go to the "Network" tab, and check "Disable cache" (requires DevTools to stay open).
3. Add a Cache-Busting Query String
If clearing the cache doesn’t work, you can append a query string to your CSS file in the href attribute to ensure the browser treats it as a new file:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=1.0">
Change the version number (v=1.0) every time you make changes to force the browser to fetch the updated file.

4. Check for Errors in Console
Open the browser's console (in DevTools) and look for any errors related to loading the styles.css file. Common issues include:

File path errors (e.g., styles.css is in a different directory).
Typos in the filename or path.
If you see an error like "Failed to load resource," double-check the path to your CSS file.

5. Verify CSS Application
Inspect an element in the browser (right-click → "Inspect") and check the "Styles" tab. You should see the rules from your styles.css file. If not:

Confirm the file is being loaded by checking the "Network" tab in DevTools. Look for styles.css and ensure its status is "200 OK."
If it’s missing, your file path might be incorrect.
6. Check for Overwritten Rules
If the CSS file is being loaded but your changes aren’t visible:

Another CSS file might be overriding your rules.
Add a more specific selector or use the !important keyword temporarily to ensure your styles take precedence:
css
Copy code
.car-card a img {
    cursor: pointer !important;
    transition: transform 0.2s !important;
}
7. Test with Inline CSS
To rule out issues with your file, try applying a style directly in the HTML:

html
Copy code
<img src="car.jpg" alt="Car Image" style="border: 5px solid red;">
If this works, the issue is with the file loading. If not, the problem might be elsewhere in your setup.

8. Verify Server Configuration
If you're using a server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP), ensure it’s configured correctly and has access to the styles.css file.

Let me know if these steps help or if you're still stuck—I can guide you further!

ah i did 2. and i think its fine now

can you help me w the details page (when receives the id of the car in the url). It looks like this: 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Sure, I can help! Based on the details page layout you provided, it seems like the page should dynamically display information about the car based on the id parameter in the URL. Here's a general outline of how to structure the PHP code for this page:

Steps to Create the Details Page
Extract the Car ID from the URL:

Use PHP to get the id parameter from the URL using $_GET['id'].
Load Car Data:

Use the storage mechanism (e.g., the JsonIO or Storage class) to load the car data and find the car matching the provided id.
Display Car Information:

Populate the page with the retrieved car details (brand, model, fuel type, etc.).
Ensure the image URL is dynamically inserted.
Example Code
Here’s an example of how your details page could look:

php
Copy code
<?php
// Include necessary files
require_once 'Storage.php'; // Assuming Storage, JsonIO are in this file

// Initialize data source
$filename = 'cars.json'; // JSON file containing car data
$storage = new Storage(new JsonIO($filename));

// Get the car ID from the URL
$carId = $_GET['id'] ?? null;

// Retrieve car details
$car = $storage->findById($carId);

// Handle case where car is not found
if (!$car) {
    echo "<h1>Car not found</h1>";
    exit;
}

CSS Considerations
To match the style in your screenshot:

Add proper margins and padding to the .car-info div.
Center-align elements as needed.
Use flexbox or grid to achieve the layout of the image and details side by side.
css
Copy code
